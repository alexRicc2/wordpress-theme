# my wordpress theme

Before uploading the .zip file to wordpress, change the name of the folder 'wordpress-theme-x.x.x' to the same name in style.css 'Text Domain', this will alow to delete the theme in the future since Wordpress looks for the folder with same name as Text Domain (you can give any text domain to your theme)
